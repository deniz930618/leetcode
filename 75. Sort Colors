Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note:
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

solution:空间复杂度为1
思路 三个指针 k 控制把所有值改写成2，当指针原值<2时，j用1覆盖掉前面的2，
当指针原值=0时，指针i添加0在开头，从而达到swap的效果
class Solution:
 def sortColors(self, nums):
    i = j = 0
    for k in xrange(len(nums)):
        v = nums[k]
        nums[k] = 2
        if v < 2:
            nums[j] = 1
            j += 1
        if v == 0:
            nums[i] = 0
            i += 1
