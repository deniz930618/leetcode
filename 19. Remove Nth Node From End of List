链表学习 
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,

   Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

   After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:
Given n will always be valid.
Try to do this in one pass.


Solution1：
class Solution(object):
   def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    self.next, nodelist  = head, [self]
    while head.next:
        if len(nodelist) == n:
            nodelist.pop(0)
        nodelist += head,
        head = head.next
    nodelist[0].next = nodelist[0].next.next 
    return self.next
